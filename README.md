### Basis

## The goal of R.O.P
R.O.P is a standard MEAN(Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) project, but we use API and token way instead of the Mongo part. The code for ROP API service, however, is not provided in this project. We would like to share this project just as an example of enterprise web applications.
